These dotfiles have been used on Ubuntu, Archlinux and most recently macOS. Until I can get Archlinux running on the Macbook 12", this will only be tested on macOS even if there's a bunch of linux-specific files committed.

## Installation

There's an outdated Makefile that I've abandoned in favor of my [`mac-playbook`](https://github.com/oxyc/mac-playbook) ansible playbook. That's where future work on installation will take place.

_This is a highly opinionated set of dotfiles, that cater to my user experience. Do **NOT** install anything you haven't looked through. For others than me, this is mostly a reference point for your own dotfiles repo._
